# How to contribute

The goal of this project is to provide an open source documentation, that any interested user can copy and adapt for their own requirements. The source files are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/jmonc/BNLM) which may be freely downloaded.

The GitHub repository currently is not ready for contributions so for now please send suggestions to ....

## Editing options

An online version is hosted on [GitBook](https://behavioural-neuroscience-uofc.gitbook.io/lab-manual/) which provides instant access and a simple intuitive interface through which content may be edited. Simple corrections such as grammar and basic formatting can be changed without requiring the installation of GitHub on the users computer.

But this online version of GitBook is limited in its scope. It is recommended that changes are done using GitHub which provides various benefits. The option to expand the features of the text using plugins, as well as a more robust version control.

Whichever method is chosen, GitBook and GitHub are linked such that changes to one will sync to the other.

## GitBook

Although it is recommended that GitHub is used, if simple edits are all that is required you may follow the following guide.

### Version control on GitBook

In GitHub, as the document is updated previous versions will still be accessible, ensuring that no information is lost incase the project needs to be reverted to a working version.

GitBook inherits a similar version control. Once the user has selected the edit button, any changes will be saved as a draft until the user is ready to either save the changes or discard the draft.

Once the draft is ready and saved, it can then be published or archived. It is highly recommended to give a short description of the changes, therefore making it easy to review past changes.

This can be done by editing the "Describe draft's changes" option, for example to "reformatted introduction". Once it is published, it will sync to the GitHub account with the new version and the changes will take effect on both sites.

It is possible that due to the simultaneous editing of drafts by more than one user there may be conflicts when the two versions are published. This can be rectified through options provided through GitHub, however it is good to be aware of this issue.

Note that the design philosophy attempts to restrict the outright deletion of drafts and previous versions, rather they are archived for future reference.

### Editing on GitBook

The language used to format the text is called Markdown, which is able to produce a HTML like output using simple syntax. Knowledge of Markdown is not required by using the interface provided.

I was considering creating an adaption of the official [GitBook documentation](https://docs.gitbook.com/content-editing), however it is concise and clear so please follow the link to understand how to edit directly on GitBook. The 'Editing Content' group in this guide covers formatting of the text in addition to embedded videos etc.
