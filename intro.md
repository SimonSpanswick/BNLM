This is a simple manual which outlines the content currently being provided by the BNLM project. The content is hosted in GitHub, while using GitBook to generate this website. This site is designed for those who are less tech savvy to have easy access to the documentation. In future updates, easy to use download links will be provided so that individual chapter pdfs and modifiable .doc files may be accessed.
